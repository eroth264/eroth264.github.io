Here are some student-run <a href="https://www.agq-cdt.org/">AGQ</a> seminars that are cool!

<h3 id="projects">GEOMETRIC INVARIANT THEORY - WINTER 2024</h3>

Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) studies the action of a group on an algebraic variety, and how we can form the "quotient" space. One motivation is to construct moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, where we want to classify geometric objects up to some form of equivalence. In this reading course, we'll aim to understand the basic constructions and techniques in GIT, and then apply them to constructing different moduli spaces, such as the moduli of vector bundles and the moduli space of curves. We will then conclude by discussing the connections to quotients in symplectic and complex geometry.

The seminar is hybrid and runs weekly on Thursdays 10:00 to 11:30 (give or take). If you want to join on Zoom or talk, <a href="{{ site.url }}">email me</a> or <a href="https://shingtaklam1324.github.io/">Shing Tak Lam</a>.

<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - Emanuel - 40 George Square 11.06 <span style="float: right; ">10th October 2024</span><br />
Explain what moduli problems are, and what a (coarse/fine) moduli space is. Explain
what can go wrong when we take a quotient by a group action, and why we need to
restrict to “stable” objects. Explain the general philosophy of constructing moduli spaces
by taking a quotient of a parameter space by a group action.</p>

<p><strong>Algebraic Groups</strong> - Campbell - Bayes 3.57 <span style="float: right; ">17th October 2024</span><br />
Define algebraic groups, group actions, orbits and stabilizers. Categorical quotients. Representations of algebraic groups, and reductive groups. Hilbert’s 14th problem and Nagata’s theorem.</p>

<p><strong>Affine and Projective GIT</strong> - Yaoqi - Bayes 3.57  <span style="float: right; "> 24th October 2024</span><br />
Construction of the affine and projective GIT quotients. Stable and semistable sets. Relation to the “geometric” quotient. Linearization. Projective GIT with respect to an ample line bundle.</p>

<p><strong>Stability</strong> - David - Bayes 3.57  <span style="float: right; "> 31st October 2024</span><br />
Topological criterion. One-parameter subgroups, linearizations. Hilbert-Mumford criterion.

<p><strong>Moduli Space of Curves I</strong> - Tudor - Bayes 5.45 <span style="float: right; "> 7th November 2024</span><br />
Hilbert schemes, construction of Hilbert schemes. Realization of the moduli space of smooth curves as a GIT quotient of a subscheme of a Hilbert scheme. Explaining GIT-(semi)-stability for the genus 1 case (i.e., for elliptic curves).

<p><strong>Moduli Space of Curves II</strong> - Noah - Bayes 4.47 <span style="float: right; "> 14th November 2024</span><br />
Mention a numerical criterion to determine the (semi)-stability Hilbert points (and Gieseker's criterion for curves). Gieseker's construction of Mg bar, and introduce Deligne-Mumford stability of curves, and compare this to the stability of Hilbert points (Potential stability theorem). Afterward, we discuss a pluricanonical embedding of DM-stable curves into a Hilbert scheme, contained within the Hilbert-stable points, and how to take a GIT quotient of this locus to construct Mg bar.

<p><strong>Moduli Space of Vector Bundles I</strong> - Emanuel - Bayes 4.47 <span style="float: right; "> 21st November 2024</span><br />
Talk about constructing the moduli space of vector bundles. Recap  vector bundles and how degrees are defined, define slope-(semi)-stability afterwards, and discuss some important consequences and examples of slope-(semi)-stability. In order to construct this moduli space, we need to parametrize quotients of bundles (of a fixed bundle) in a fine moduli space, called a Quot scheme. Taking the locus of semistable vector bundles within this scheme, and GIT quotienting out by a GLn action will give us the moduli space of vector bundles we want. Quot schemes are a generalization of Hilbert schemes (from Tudor and Noah's talks), whose construction mirrors that of Hilbert schemes.


<p><strong>Moduli Space of Vector Bundles II</strong> - Ander - Bayes 3.57 <span style="float: right; "> 28th November 2024</span><br />
Continue our construction of the moduli space of vector bundles that we started last week. Topics include constructing a projective GIT quotient of a subscheme of a Quot scheme (corresponding to the locus of semistable vector bundles). This GIT quotient should be a coarse moduli space of vector bundles of rank r and degree d, and using the Hilbert-Mumford criterion, we can conclude that GIT-(semi)-stability is equivalent to slope-(semi)-stability.
