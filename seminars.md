<h3 id="projects">GEOMETRIC INVARIANT THEORY - WINTER 2024</h3>

Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) studies the action of a group on an algebraic variety, and how we can form the "quotient" space. One motivation is to construct moduli spaces in algebraic geometry, where we want to classify geometric objects up to some form of equivalence. In this reading course, we'll aim to understand the basic constructions and techniques in GIT, and then apply them to constructing different moduli spaces, such as the moduli of vector bundles and the moduli space of curves. We will then conclude by discussing the connections to quotients in symplectic and complex geometry.

The seminar is hybrid and runs weekly on Thursdays 9:30 to 10:00 (give or take). If you want to join on Zoom or talk, <a href="{{ site.url }}">email me</a> or <a href="https://shingtaklam1324.github.io/">Shing Tak Lam</a>.

<p><strong>Motivation</strong> - Emanuel - 40 George Square 11.06 <span style="float: right; ">10th October 2024</span><br />
Explain what moduli problems are, and what a (coarse/fine) moduli space is. Explain
what can go wrong when we take a quotient by a group action, and why we need to
restrict to “stable” objects. Explain the general philosophy of constructing moduli spaces
by taking a quotient of a parameter space by a group action.</p>
